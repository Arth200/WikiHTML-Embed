# WikiHTML-Embed
This code is designed to perform the following actions:

    Prompt the user to enter a search term.
    Utilize the Wikipedia API to search for this term and retrieve the corresponding page content.
    If the Wikipedia page is found, extract the content of the page in HTML format.
    Generate a separate HTML file named "wikipedia_content.html" to contain the Wikipedia page content.
    Then, create a main HTML page (named "output.html") that embeds the content of "wikipedia_content.html" within an <iframe> tag.
    The "output.html" file is generated and saved locally.
    The user can subsequently open the "output.html" file in a web browser to view the Wikipedia page content within the <iframe> tag.

In summary, this code allows for searching and displaying the content of a specific Wikipedia page within a locally generated HTML page. This could be useful for integrating Wikipedia content into web pages or automatically generated reports.
